"""
	In our Othello project, we rendered our perception of Othello in a cubist form. Starting from Mayaâ€™s creation of a Spanish-esque melody, we decided on creating a cubist drawing that appears fragmented and abstracted, much like characteristics of the Cubist art movement. Correspondingly, our artwork embraces elements that symbolizes the motif of lies/truth and gender roles within Othello. 

The fragmented mirrors express the distinct perspectives Iago conforms to, based on his audience. These geometric shapes represent walls closing in on Desdemona, making it seem like she is claustrophobic. The eye symbolizes the green-eyed monster (Iago) while the arm kills Desdemona on the right. As his large hand is directly coming out from his chest, it delineates how his hatred towards Desdemona comes from his heart and overpowers Desdemona. This could possibly attest to the patriarchal power structure rooted within Othello and possibly of how jealous he is of Desdemonaâ€™s purity. As well, it reveals the way Iago dictates Othelloâ€™s jealousy and hatred towards Desdemona, controlling his emotions through his lies. Additionally, Desdemona was inspired by the painting The Scream by Edvard Munch which builds a very anxious and disturbed ambience. We chose to interpret Othello in a Cubist way since Othello is a play set in a war period, just as the Cubist art movement was a response to the war, evoking a serious and violent sentimentality.

            Cubism began in the early twentieth century by artist Pablo Picasso. To emphasize the two-dimensionality of nature in rejection of the way art had copied nature up until then, artists of this movement would reduce objects to its most basic form and compose geometric shapes and linear structures based on a 2-D perspective. Artists would analyze and dissect certain objects in multiple perspectives and accordingly draw each of them. To the viewer, cubist artworks are usually indiscernible because of how abstract and intricately layered they are. Yet, it gives the audience a true, even multidimensional perspective within a two dimensional plane.
